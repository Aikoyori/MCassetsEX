# Aikoyori's minecraft assets extractor

Totally works 100% of the time, trust me.

## Why?

Because assets extraction from assets/objects folder is a pain in the ass thing to do by hand. plus I want to try out
writing in node.js so I can be familiar with it.

## How to runâ„¢

1. Get node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Download this as zip and extract this somewhere or clone this using git command.

3. Open terminal / command prompt / whatever you put these files in then run.

```
npm install
```
Then wait then

```
node index.js
```

Then it will prompt stuff you just type stuff it asked.
